How hungry are you? 

This application works best if used natively in Visual Studio. Press run or F5 to begin

Peckish returns a side dish
Hungry returns a main
Starved returns a main and a side dish

Type one of the above in and press enter

There is a glitch where trying to change your answer will result in the program looping and returning the same items several times.
I didn't fix it because honestly, I found it amusing.

Have Fun!
